# HAR-using-2-sensor-data

This repository reads the sensor data from the csv file and plots the line and 3D graphs.
  1. Raw data
  2. Median filter applied to raw data
  3. Low pass filter (lpf) applied to raw data
  4. Comnined median and lpf data
  
Here, I have considered only 1 csv file containing raw data from 3-axis accelerometer.
The data used is from realworld2016_dataset which can be found here : https://sensor.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/#dataset
